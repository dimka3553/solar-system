              <h3>Sun</h3>
              <p>
                The Sun is the star at the center of the Solar System. It is a
                nearly perfect ball of hot plasma, heated to incandescence by
                nuclear fusion reactions in its core. The Sun radiates this
                energy mainly as light, ultraviolet, and infrared radiation, and
                is the most important source of energy for life on Earth.

                days, the shortest of all the Sun's planets.

                Venus is the second planet from the Sun. It is sometimes called
                Earth's "sister" or "twin" planet as it is almost as large and
                has a similar composition. As an interior planet to Earth, Venus
                appears in Earth's sky never far from the Sun, either as morning
                star or evening star.

              <p>
                Earth is the third planet from the Sun and the only astronomical
                object known to harbor life. While large volumes of water can be
                found throughout the Solar System, only Earth sustains liquid
                surface water. About 71% of Earth's surface is made up of the
                ocean, dwarfing Earth's polar ice, lakes, and rivers.

                Mars is the fourth planet from the Sun and the second-smallest
                planet in the Solar System, being larger than only Mercury. In
                the English language, Mars is named for the Roman god of war.

              <p>
                Jupiter is the fifth planet from the Sun and the largest in the
                Solar System. It is a gas giant with a mass more than two and a
                half times that of all the other planets in the Solar System
                combined, but slightly less than one-thousandth the mass of the

                Saturn is the sixth planet from the Sun and the second-largest
                in the Solar System, after Jupiter. It is a gas giant with an
                average radius of about nine and a half times that of Earth. It
                has only one-eighth the average density of Earth; however, with
                its larger volume, Saturn is over 95 times more massive. It has
                a massive ring system.

                Uranus is the seventh planet from the Sun. Its name is a
                reference to the Greek god of the sky, Uranus, who, according to
                Greek mythology, was the great-grandfather of Ares, grandfather
                of Zeus and father of Cronus. It has the third-largest planetary
                radius and fourth-largest planetary mass in the Solar System.

                Neptune is the eighth planet from the Sun and the farthest known
                solar planet. In the Solar System, it is the fourth-largest
                planet by diameter, the third-most-massive planet, and the
                densest giant planet. It is 17 times the mass of Earth, and

                beyond the orbit of Neptune. It is the ninth-largest and
                tenth-most-massive known object to directly orbit the Sun. It is
                the largest known trans-Neptunian object by volume, by a small
                margin, but is slightly less massive than Eris.
